## Framework Overview

The Military Innovation Assessment Framework is a four-dimensional analytical tool designed to distinguish genuine military innovations from modernizations, upgrades, and adaptations. Based on the theoretical work "Military Innovation: Between the Knowns and the Unknowns" by Manabrata Guha, this framework provides rigorous analytical structure for evaluating military technological and doctrinal changes.

### Core Principle
Innovation requires both **cognitive transformation** (new ways of thinking) AND **irreversible institutional embedding** (permanent organizational change). Technologies or concepts that lack either element represent modernization or adaptation rather than genuine innovation.

### Recognition Criteria
**Primary Threshold**: Cognitive ≥ 3 AND Irreversibility ≥ 3
- Both dimensions must meet the threshold simultaneously
- Innovation cannot occur without both cognitive transformation and institutional embedding

## Getting Started

### Who Should Use This Framework
- Military analysts and strategists
- Academic researchers studying military transformation
- Defense policy makers
- Students of military history and strategy
- Technology assessment professionals

### What You Need
1. Detailed knowledge of the military development you're assessing
2. Historical context of the technology/doctrine being evaluated
3. Evidence of implementation and institutional response
4. Understanding of adversary reactions and adaptations

### Before You Begin
- Ensure you're assessing a **completed implementation**, not ongoing experiments
- Gather evidence across all four dimensions
- Prepare to justify each sub-indicator score with specific examples
- Consider the temporal boundaries of your assessment

## Understanding the Four Dimensions

### 1. Cognitive Dimension
**Definition**: Doctrine, training, and mental models change to accommodate the novelty.

**What it Measures**: The degree to which military thinking fundamentally changed to incorporate new concepts, procedures, or understanding.

**Key Questions**:
- Did core assumptions about warfare change?
- Were new operational concepts required?
- Did doctrine and training need revision?
- Were new success criteria established?

**Innovation Indicators**:
- Prospective rather than retrospective change
- New conceptual frameworks required
- Fundamental revision of doctrine and training materials
- Establishment of new measures of effectiveness

### 2. Irreversibility Dimension  
**Definition**: Prior doctrine ceases to be viable as decisive practice; no rational return.

**What it Measures**: The degree to which changes became permanently embedded in military institutions, making return to previous methods impractical or impossible.

**Key Questions**:
- Are new training pipelines established?
- Has infrastructure been irreversibly modified?
- Are adversaries compelled to mirror the change?
- Do sunk costs prevent return to previous methods?

**Innovation Indicators**:
- Specialized training programs institutionalized
- Infrastructure investments that cannot be reversed
- Adversary adoption or fundamental counter-adaptation
- Organizational structures permanently modified

### 3. Disruption Dimension
**Definition**: Adversaries are compelled to abandon or radically alter existing methods.

**What it Measures**: The degree to which changes force adversaries to fundamentally revise
