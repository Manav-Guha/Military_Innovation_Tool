While seemingly simple, barbed wire fundamentally changed the nature of warfare.

        "Multi-Domain Battle Concept": { scores: { discontinuity: 1, irreversibility: 1, generative: 2, cognitive: 2 }, justification: "This is a **Modernization**. This concept is an important, but so far incomplete, doctrinal evolution. It aims to integrate multiple domains of warfare, representing a significant conceptual leap.

Network-Centric Warfare fundamentally re-conceptualized the battlefield as a network of sensors and shooters.

        "Nuclear Weapons": { scores: { discontinuity: 2, irreversibility: 2, generative: 2, cognitive: 2 }, justification: "This is a **Genuine Innovation** and arguably the most significant of the 20th century. Nuclear weapons created a new state of war (Mutually Assured Destruction) that permanently altered international relations and military strategy.

        "PGMs": { scores: { discontinuity: 2, irreversibility: 2, generative: 2, cognitive: 1 }, justification: "This is a **Modernization**. Precision-guided munitions are a significant improvement in lethality and efficiency, but they did not force a complete doctrinal rewrite.

They were highly generative, leading to follow-on capabilities like UAVs, but have not created the type of fundamental disruption seen in genuine innovations.", sources: ["Richard P. Hallion, *Precision-Guided Munitions and the Revolution in Warfare* (1995)"] },
        "Radar": { scores: { discontinuity: 2, irreversibility: 2, generative: 1, cognitive: 1 }, justification: "This is classified as a **Genuine Innovation**. Radar's impact was transformative. It instantly disrupted the OODA loop of air attacks, turning a surprise raid into a predictable event.

        "Stealth": { scores: { discontinuity: 2, irreversibility: 1, generative: 1, cognitive: 0 }, justification: "This is a **Modernization**. Stealth is a major technological leap, but it has not fully disrupted the enemy OODA loop or forced adversaries to completely scrap their air defenses.

Stirrups were a fundamental innovation that unlocked the full potential of mounted shock warfare. They broke existing patterns of combat by enabling a mounted knight to deliver the full force of a charge, created irreversible societal and military structures, and were highly generative, forming the basis for new cavalry doctrines that lasted for centuries.", sources: ["Lynn White, Jr., *Medieval Technology and Social Change* (1962)"] },
        "Stosstrupp Tactics": { scores: { discontinuity: 2, irreversibility: 1, generative: 1, cognitive: 2 }, justification: "This is classified as a **Genuine Innovation**. This non-technological innovation introduced a completely new method of bypassing a static front line, breaking the stalemate of trench warfare. While it had limited physical irreversibility, it created a massive, permanent change in tactical thinking and spawned a range of new small-unit tactics and training methods.", sources: ["Bruce I. Gudmundsson, *Stormtroop Tactics: Innovation in the German Army, 1914-1918* (1989)"] },
        "T-72B3M Main Battle Tank": { scores: { discontinuity: 0, irreversibility: 1, generative: 1, cognitive: 0 }, justification: "This is an **Upgradation**. The T-72B3M is a modernization of an existing tank, not a new design. It adds a new engine, fire control system, and a new main gun. These improvements are significant, but they do not change the tank's core role or doctrine. It is an important improvement but not a revolutionary one.", sources: ["Charles K. Bartles, *The Russian Army: New Military Capability* (2015)"] },
        "Tank": { scores: { discontinuity: 2, irreversibility: 2, generative: 2, cognitive: 2 }, justification: "This is a **Genuine Innovation**. The tank broke the tactical stalemate of World War I, forcing a complete reconceptualization of maneuver warfare. Its development required enormous, irreversible investments in production and logistics. It was highly generative, leading to a family of armored vehicles and follow-on doctrines like Blitzkrieg, and became a central pillar of military power.", sources: ["J.P. Harris, *Men, Ideas, and Tanks: British Military Thought and Armoured Forces, 1903-1939* (1995)"] },
        "Telegraph": { scores: { discontinuity: 2, irreversibility: 2, generative: 2, cognitive: 2 }, justification: "This is classified as a **Genuine Innovation**. The military use of the telegraph was a seminal innovation. It completely shattered the historical reliance on couriers and physical command links, disrupting the time-space compression of the battlefield. It required a vast, irreversible investment in global networks and operators, and completely rewrote the theory of command and control.", sources: ["David Hochfelder, *The Telegraph in America, 1832-1920* (2012)"] },
        "UAVs": { scores: { discontinuity: 1, irreversibility: 1, generative: 2, cognitive: 1 }, justification: "This is a **Modernization**. While UAVs have been a significant game-changer in specific contexts, they have largely extended existing doctrines (e.g., reconnaissance and strike) rather than breaking them.
