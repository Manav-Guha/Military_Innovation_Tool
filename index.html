While UAVs have been a significant game-changer in specific contexts, they have largely extended existing doctrines (e.g., reconnaissance and strike) rather than breaking them.

The Anti-Ship Ballistic Missile threatens to break the U.S. Navy's reliance on large aircraft carriers by creating a new kill-chain topology.

While they disrupt the OODA loop and could rewrite defense doctrine, they haven't yet created the irreversible logistical changes or force-structure pivots needed to qualify as a genuine innovation.
