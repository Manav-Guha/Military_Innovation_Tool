**STUDENT'S PROPOSED CAPABILITY:**
${capability}

**STUDENT'S RESEARCH CONTEXT:**
${researchText}

**YOUR ASSESSMENT TASK:**
Using the research provided above, score this capability from 0 (not present) to 2 (strongly present) on each dimension below. Provide specific evidence from the research to justify each score.

**FOUR-DIMENSIONAL FRAMEWORK:**

**1. DISCONTINUITY (Score 0-2):**
Does this capability break existing patterns rather than extending them?
Indicators: ${dimensions.discontinuity.indicators.join('; ')}

**2. IRREVERSIBILITY (Score 0-2):**
Does this capability create new baseline conditions that cannot be undone?
Indicators: ${dimensions.irreversibility.indicators.join('; ')}

**3. GENERATIVE CAPACITY (Score 0-2):**
Does this capability spawn further developments across multiple domains?
Indicators: ${dimensions.generative.indicators.join('; ')}

**4. COGNITIVE DISRUPTION (Score 0-2):**
Does this capability force fundamental reconceptualization of warfare?
Indicators: ${dimensions.cognitive.indicators.join('; ')}

**REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:**

**ASSESSMENT: "${capability}"**

**DIMENSION SCORES:**
- Discontinuity: [0, 1, or 2]
- Irreversibility: [0, 1, or 2] 
- Generative Capacity: [0, 1, or 2]
- Cognitive Disruption: [0, 1, or 2]
**Total Score: [Sum]/8**

**EVIDENCE-BASED RATIONALE:**

**Discontinuity:** [Quote specific evidence from research and explain score]

**Irreversibility:** [Quote specific evidence from research and explain score]

**Generative Capacity:** [Quote specific evidence from research and explain score]

**Cognitive Disruption:** [Quote specific evidence from research and explain score]

**FINAL CLASSIFICATION:**
Based on the decision rule (≥6 points total AND includes Irreversibility ≥1 OR Cognitive Disruption ≥1):
- [ ] Genuine Innovation
- [ ] Watch Category  
- [ ] Modernization

**OVERALL ASSESSMENT:**
[Provide final judgment on whether this represents genuine military innovation and recommendations for further development]

**CRITICAL EVALUATION:**
[Point out any gaps in the student's research or areas where more evidence would strengthen the analysis]`;
